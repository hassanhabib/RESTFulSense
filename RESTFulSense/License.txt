0. Ethical Use Condition
Software under this license may be used for personal or commercial purposes.
We encourage its use for humanitarian efforts and projects that serve the survival, evolution, and fulfillment of mankind.

However, this software may not be used, directly or indirectly, in any project that contributes to or facilitates:
- The threatening of human survival,
- The hindrance of human evolution,
- The diminishment of human fulfillment.

This ethical condition is non-negotiable and applies to all users, distributors, and modifiers.

1. Freedom and Sharing
Software under this license is free as in free tea and free speech.

It is encouraged to be:
- Used freely, as long as the Ethical Use Condition is upheld.
- Modified to improve and adapt it to new use cases.
- Distributed in original or modified form.
- Studied and learned from as a tool for innovation and education.

2. License and Attribution
- This license must remain attached to all original and modified versions of the software.
- If you modify this software, you must clearly state your changes.
- You may not misrepresent the origin of the software or claim original authorship of unmodified parts.

3. AI and Automation
If this software is used in artificial intelligence systems, automated decision-making, or data-driven platforms, the implementers must:
- Evaluate the application’s compliance with the Ethical Use Condition (section 0),
- Mitigate any foreseeable risks that may violate that condition,
- Document how the use aligns with the license’s ethical principles.

4. Irrevocability and Permanence of Freedom
- This license is perpetual and irrevocable.
- Once software is released under this license, the author cannot revoke, re-license, or retroactively restrict its freedoms.
- Future versions of The Standard Software License may be released to clarify or extend its terms, but existing licensed software remains bound to its original version.

5. Commercial Use and Non-Monetization of the Licensed Software
- You may use this software in commercial projects, businesses, and for-profit environments.
- You may charge for services (e.g. support, consulting, hosting, integrations) built around this software.
- However, you may not sell, license, or charge for access, usage, distribution, or copies of the software itself.

You can profit with it, but not from it directly.

This ensures that once made free, the software remains free forever—regardless of popularity or success.

6. Derivative and Combined Works
- If this software is combined with other software, the portions under this license must continue to follow these terms, including the Ethical Use Condition and Non-Monetization rule.
- Derivative works must clearly separate code under this license if the resulting project uses different licensing for other components.

7. No Warranty
This software is provided "as-is", without warranty of any kind.
The authors are not liable for any damages or misuse, except where such liability arises from intentional violation of the Ethical Use Condition.
